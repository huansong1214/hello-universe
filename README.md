## Features

### What's Up Monthly Skywatching Tips Video
- API: Fetches the latest video from NASAâ€™s YouTube playlist using the YouTube Data API.
- UI: React component loads video data, handles loading and errors, and embeds the video with title and description.

### Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) Calendar
- API: Fetches NASA APOD data by date or range with error handling.
- Hook: Caches monthly APOD data in-memory and localStorage, managing loading and errors.
- UI: Interactive calendar with thumbnails and date selection opening a modal with details. Supports lazy loading and keyboard navigation.

### Mars Rover Camera Usage Visualization

#### Mars Rover Missions Timeline
- API: Uses NASA Mars Photos API to fetch mission manifests (status, launch/landing dates, total photos).
- UI: Timeline of rover missions sorted by landing date (most recent first). Each rover appears as a flip card with mission details and link to camera usage data.

#### Mars Rover Camera Usage Visualization
- API: Fetches rover manifest data from NASA Mars Photos API and calculates sols each camera was used. Cameras grouped into Engineering, Science, or Entry/Descent/Landing categories.
- UI: Interactive D3 bar chart visualizes camera activity by sol count, color-coded by category. Sidebar shows camera details on hover and clickable legend toggles categories.

#### Mars Rover Camera Reference Table
- API: Retrieves camera metadata from a Notion database via the Notion API, filtered by rover.
- UI: Responsive table lists camera abbreviation, full name, and category, sorted by category for easy reference.

### Contact Form
- API: Sends emails via Resend API with inputs validated by Zod, returning detailed errors.
- UI: React form with name, email, and message fields. Validation and server errors appear together in a single error block to prevent layout shifts. Submit button disables during submission, and form resets on success.
