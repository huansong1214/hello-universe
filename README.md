# Hello Universe

## Description

This project integrates NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to display the date, title, explanation, and the image itself.

## Why I chose to work on the project

I wanted to test the waters with the React library by building a single-page application.

I followed the tutorial at [react.dev/learn](https://react.dev/learn) to create this app using the Next.js framework and deployed it on Vercel: [hello-universe-ruddy.vercel.app](https://hello-universe-ruddy.vercel.app).

I hope to build my capstone project on top of this foundation by integrating additional NASA or telescope APIs and adding the required features.
